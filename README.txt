There are 4 files in total.

1. Capstone Project Report.pdf --> Capstone Report
2. Capstone Project Image Classification CIFAR.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook containing all the models ran

3. AppPrototype --> This is the python file that utilitizes the trained model to identify objects through webcam.
4. CNN_model4.h5 --> This is the model that the AppPrototype uses. If you want to run the AppPrototype, you will need to have this model (or you can run the model in Jupyter Notebook again :)).
