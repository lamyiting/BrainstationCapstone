1. Technical Report.pdf --> Summary of the Project
2. Preprocessing, EDA and CNN Modelling.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook containing work on optimizing parameters of CNN models 

3. AppPrototype --> This is the python file that utilitizes the trained model to identify objects through webcam.
4. CNN_model6.h5 --> This is the model that the AppPrototype uses. If you want to run the AppPrototype, you will need to have this model (or you can run the model in Jupyter Notebook again :)).
